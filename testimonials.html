                        <h3>Frank De Tank - Plumber</h3>
                        <q>Back in the good ol' days I would get customers from all over Antwerp thanks to the magical Gele Gids phonebook. But during the second half of the 2000's it was clear that this business model wasn't working anymore. A website had to be the solution. So we hired a company to make one for us. After a while we found out they were total frauds. Sure, the website looked nice but no one found us on search engines like Google and Yahoo. At this time I was totally depressed, started using heroin and prostituted myself out, just in order to keep my plumbing business afloat. Now, thanks to the incredible team of JACS I'm my business is flourishing again. Due to a nice combination of SEO, SEA and ofcourse a beautiful, user-friendly website I get calls from all over Flanders. I'm no longer high on smack, I'm high on plumbing! Thanks so much to Snehal, Andy, Jelle and CÃ©dric for their patience and their efforts to make my business succesfull again.</q>
